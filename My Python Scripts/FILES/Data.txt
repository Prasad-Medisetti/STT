The World Wide Web and its associated distributed information services, such as
Yahoo!, Google, America Online, and AltaVista, provide rich, worldwide, on-line information
services, where data objects are linked together to facilitate interactive access.
Users seeking information of interest traverse from one object via links to another.
Such systems provide ample opportunities and challenges for data mining. For example,
understanding user access patterns will not only help improve system design (by
providing efficient access between highly correlated objects), but also leads to better
marketing decisions (e.g., by placing advertisements in frequently visited documents,
or by providing better customer/user classification and behavior analysis). Capturing
user access patterns in such distributed information environments is called Web usage
mining (or Weblog mining).
